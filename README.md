# US-State-Game
This is a simple Interactive Game developed using Python Pandas and Turtle Module.
The major files are as follows:
50_states.csv: It contain states name and x,y coordinates of 50 states.
The x,y coordinates are relative to the position of state in the blank_states_img.gif.
The program opens the blank_states_img.gif in Turtle module and you have to guess the state name.
If the state name is correct then it will locate it on the Map. 
On writing "Exit" in the prompt it will create a file of the states which you were unable to guess.
